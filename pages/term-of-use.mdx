Unless otherwise specified in a Subscription, these fees will be billed in advance for each month and are non-refundable. You acknowledge that you will not receive refunds or credits for partial months of service or for periods in which your Account remains open but is unused. If you exceed any usage or fee thresholds outlined in your Subscription, we may charge you for such overages on your next invoice.

We reserve the right to modify our billing rates at the time of renewal with thirty (30) days' written notice by posting fee changes on the Site or notifying you via email. Continued use of the Services after these changes means you agree to the new Subscription/billing rate.

By providing your credit card number, you authorize Monstro and our third-party service providers to store your payment card information and to charge you for:
1. Subscription fees billed during a Subscription Period,
2. Additional fees for Services purchased (including Add-Ons), and
3. Applicable taxes.

You agree to reimburse us for any collection costs and interest on overdue amounts. Should your payment card expire without updating the information or canceling your Subscription, you authorize us to suspend your Account until updated billing details are provided. After suspension, we may re-attempt payment processing.

### 5. Term and Renewal

- Your paid Subscription is valid for either a monthly or an annual Subscription Period.
- If you upgrade to a higher-level Subscription during a Subscription Period, you will have immediate access to the higher-level features and will pay the difference.
- If you downgrade during a Subscription Period, you will receive a credit representing the cost difference.
- Changes to Subscriptions will be reflected in your next invoice. No credits or refunds will be issued for downgrading from a paid subscription to a Free Account (cancellation).
- Your Subscription will automatically renew for an additional period unless canceled (see Section 6).

### 6. Termination & Cancellation

- **Cancellation by the Customer:**  
  You ("The Customer") may cancel your monthly Subscription at any time via your Account or by sending an email ticket to [`support@mymonstro.com`](mailto:support@mymonstro.com), including the email address associated with your Account.
  
  If you request Cancellation or account deletion, Monstro may verify your identity by asking for the last four (4) digits of the credit card on file, the card type, billing address, and additional security questions.
  
  To cancel by phone, you must similarly verify your credit card details and answer security questions.

- **Timing of Cancellation:**  
  Cancellations must be completed at least one (1) day prior to the end of your current Subscription Period (monthly or annual) to avoid automatic billing for the next period. Cancellations performed after billing are not eligible for refunds.

- **Outstanding Charges:**  
  You are responsible for all charges incurred up to the time of Cancellation, including fees for the current Subscription Period.

- **After Cancellation:**  
  Upon Cancellation, your Account becomes a Free Account. Monstro will delete the Account (including pages, popups, sticky bars, Content, leads, email address, and other Personal Data) within one (1) month of Cancellation unless you re-subscribe or make other arrangements. Monstro is not responsible for any Content lost due to Account deletion.
  
  We reserve the right to modify our data storage and processing procedures at any time, without notice, subject to applicable laws.
  
- **Termination for Cause:**  
  Monstro may terminate this Agreement with 10 days' notice, for cause (e.g., breach of these Terms). Additionally, Monstro may modify, suspend, or discontinue the Site and/or Services (or any portion thereof) with 30 days' notice.
  
  Sections on Content Submission, Intellectual Property Rights, Confidential Information, Third Party Sites and Content, Disclaimer, Exclusion, and Limitation of Liability, Indemnification, Waiver of Jury Trial and Class Action Rights, and Dispute Resolution will survive termination.

### 7. Six Month Money Back Guarantee

If we do not achieve a total lead capture ratio of **15% or better** from your Google Business Profile traffic over the first 5 calendar months that your website is live, then at your request, we will cancel your Subscription and issue a full refund of all plan fees (including the down payment), provided you meet the "Good Faith Conditions" outlined below.
