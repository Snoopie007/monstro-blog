## 4. PLANS, PRICING, AND FEES

### 4.1 Monstro-X Subscription Plans

Monstro-X currently offers the following core Plans, which replace and supersede prior plan structures in earlier agreements.

- **Free Plan**: Designed for locations with under approximately twenty-five members. No monthly subscription fee applies, but the plan is subject to transaction fees on digital payments processed through Monstro-X.
- **Start-up Plan**: A monthly subscription currently listed as ninety-nine dollars per month on the pricing page, intended for locations with roughly twenty-five to one hundred members, with access to AI support and Monstro Marketing tools.
- **Growth Plan**: A monthly subscription currently listed as two hundred ninety-nine dollars per month on the pricing page for schools with one hundred or more members, designed for scaling and retention with reduced transaction fees and additional features such as a done-for-you website.

Exact prices, included features, and any promotions or discounts are as shown on the then-current Monstro-X pricing page and may change over time. Any changes will take effect upon your next renewal unless otherwise stated. We will provide at least thirty (30) days advance notice of any price increases for your existing Subscription tier.

### 4.2 Transaction Fees

In addition to any monthly Subscription fee, for the Free and Start-up Plans, digital transactions processed through Monstro-X are subject to a Monstro transaction fee currently at two percent (2%) plus Stripe's processing fees. For the Growth Plan, digital transactions processed through Monstro-X are subject only to Stripe's fees with no additional Monstro transaction fee.

The Monstro transaction fee applies only to digital transactions processed through the Monstro-X platform and our Third Party Processor. You are not charged a Monstro transaction fee on cash payments, checks, or manual transactions that you collect directly and do not process through Monstro-X.

We reserve the right to modify transaction fees for new billing cycles, with notice in accordance with Section 16 below.

### 4.3 Support Upgrades

We may offer optional support upgrades at additional monthly fees. Basic Support is included with all Plans and provides ticket-based support, knowledge base access, group calls, and response times subject to workload.

- **Premium Support** is available for an additional monthly fee and includes priority support, limited hours of maintenance, and faster response times.
- **Dedicated Support** is available for an additional monthly fee and provides expanded hours of maintenance, event or funnel setup, priority support, and dedicated account assistance.

The current features and pricing for each support tier are posted on our website or in your order form and may be updated from time to time.

### 4.4 Usage-Based Fees

In addition to Subscription fees and transaction fees, you may incur usage-based fees when you use certain features of the Services. Usage-based fees may include, without limitation, fees for SMS or MMS messages, voice calls, or other carrier-based communications sent or received through the Services, fees for emails or other messages sent in excess of any included monthly limits, fees for AI, automation, or other metered services such as per-message, per-token, or per-event charges, and any other metered or overage charges described on the Monstro-X pricing page or in your order form.

The current rates and billing units for usage-based fees are described on the then-current Monstro-X pricing page or your order form and are incorporated into these Terms by reference. By enabling or using features that generate usage-based fees, you agree to pay the applicable usage-based fees. We may adjust usage-based rates from time to time, and any changes will apply to future usage after we post the updated pricing or otherwise notify you.

## 5. PAYMENT PROCESSING, PAYOUTS, REFUNDS AND DISPUTES

### 5.1 Role of Monstro-X and Third Party Processor

Monstro-X uses Stripe or other Third Party Processors to process member payments on your behalf. By using the payment features of the Services, you agree to the applicable Stripe terms and conditions in addition to these Terms.

For digital payments processed through Monstro-X, Monstro-X collects payment from the Member as a limited payment collection agent for you, the Business. After Stripe's processing fees and any applicable Monstro transaction fee depending on your Plan are deducted, the net amount is distributed to you via Stripe or another settlement method we support.

You authorize Monstro-X and the Third Party Processor to debit amounts paid by your Members, deduct applicable fees, credit the remaining balance to your payout account, and debit your payout account or your card on file as needed for refunds, disputes, or negative balances as described below.

### 5.2 Non-Digital Payments

Monstro-X transaction fees apply only to digital transactions processed through the Monstro-X platform and our Third Party Processor. We do not charge a Monstro transaction fee on cash payments collected directly by you, check, bank transfer, or other offline payments that are not processed through Monstro-X, or manual entries you record in the system solely for tracking purposes without payment actually flowing through the platform.

You remain solely responsible for collecting, recording, and accounting for any offline or manual payments.

### 5.3 Refunds

You are responsible for your own refund policies with your Members. However, when a refund is processed for a digital transaction that went through Monstro-X, refunds are initiated through Monstro-X and processed by the Third Party Processor currently Stripe, and the refunded amount including any Stripe fees that are not recoverable under Stripe's policies will be debited from your Stripe or payout balance.

If there is not enough balance to cover the refund, Monstro-X, directly or via the Third Party Processor, may attempt to debit the negative amount from your payout account multiple times and, if still not successful, charge the credit card or other payment method on file for your Monstro-X Account to satisfy the outstanding balance.

Refunds will typically be reflected to the Member within the time frame Stripe or the relevant processor allows, often a few business days, which may vary by bank and region.

### 5.4 Disputes and Chargebacks

The above process also applies to disputes and chargebacks initiated by Members. If a Member disputes a charge processed through Monstro-X, the disputed amount, plus any dispute fees charged by Stripe or the relevant processor, will be debited from your payout balance.

If sufficient funds are not available, Monstro-X reserves the right to attempt to collect the negative amount from your payout account, charge the credit card or other payment method on file, or withhold or delay future payouts until the negative balance is resolved.

You are responsible for responding to and managing disputes with Members, including providing any documentation requested by Stripe or Monstro-X to contest a chargeback. We may suspend your ability to accept payments or use the Services if you have unresolved negative balances, excessive disputes, or violations of our or Stripe's policies.

## 6. CUSTOMER RESPONSIBILITIES

You are responsible for providing accurate and current information to Monstro-X, as well as any access, content, or cooperation we reasonably require to operate, configure, troubleshoot, or improve the Services associated with your Account. You must ensure that your use of the Services, and that of your Members, complies with all applicable federal, state, local, and international laws and regulations, including but not limited to those relating to consumer protection, privacy, marketing, intellectual property, and billing within your jurisdiction.

You are solely responsible for managing your Members and your relationships with them, including but not limited to setting prices, offering promotions, making refund decisions, managing service quality, and maintaining up-to-date and valid consents for the collection and use of Members’ personal data as required by law. You represent and warrant that you have obtained all necessary legal rights, licenses, and permissions to upload, use, or share any content through the Services.

We are not liable for any failure to provide the Services resulting from your omission to submit required information, content, or access. You agree not to use the Services for any unlawful purpose or in any way that infringes or misappropriates the rights, including intellectual property rights, of any third party. You accept sole responsibility for any claims relating to third-party rights, including any content you or your Members upload, transmit, or use via the Services.

## 7. COMMUNITY FEATURES AND USER CONTENT

### 7.1 Ownership and Responsibility

Monstro-X enables Community Features that allow you, your staff, and your Members to create, post, like, comment on, and share user-generated content—including but not limited to text, images, and media—within your Account’s community. 

As the Account Owner/Administrator for each Business or location, you are solely responsible for supervising, policing, and moderating all Community Features associated with your Account. You are responsible for establishing and communicating community rules and codes of conduct to your Members, provided those rules are consistent with these Terms and applicable laws.

All user-generated content within your community (“Community Content”) is your sole responsibility to moderate and enforce. Monstro-X has no obligation to monitor or police Community Content on your behalf and assumes no liability for any content created or posted by you, your staff, or your Members.

### 7.2 Prohibited Content

You agree that you and your Members will not use the Community Features to post, transmit, or share any content that:

- Is illegal, defamatory, obscene, pornographic, or otherwise offensive;
- Promotes hate, harassment, discrimination, or threats of violence against any person or group;
- Infringes or misappropriates any intellectual property, privacy, or publicity rights;
- Constitutes spam, scams, misleading advertising, or unauthorized solicitation;
- Contains malware, viruses, or any code intended to disrupt, damage, or compromise systems or data; or
- Violates any applicable law, rule, or regulation.

You must promptly remove or direct the removal of any prohibited content you become aware of within your community.

### 7.3 Monstro-X Rights

Although Monstro-X is not obligated to monitor Community Content, we reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to review, remove, or restrict access to any content we believe, in good faith, violates these Terms or applicable law. We also reserve the right to suspend or terminate user access to the Community Features, or to disclose information to law enforcement or other authorities if we reasonably believe it is necessary to do so.

Despite these rights, you remain primarily responsible for moderating your community and handling complaints, disputes, or issues arising among your Members.

### 7.4 No Responsibility for Policing Communities

To the maximum extent permitted by law, you acknowledge and agree that Monstro-X is not responsible or liable for any content posted by you, your staff, or your Members. Monstro-X does not assume or undertake any duty to monitor, police, or enforce your community rules. Any claims, losses, or damages—including but not limited to defamation, harassment, or privacy violations—arising from Community Content are solely between you and the relevant Member(s) and are subject to the indemnification and limitation of liability provisions set forth elsewhere in these Terms.

Fees are generally billed in advance for Subscription Periods and in arrears for usage-based fees and transaction fees, and are non-refundable except where required by law or expressly stated otherwise in this Agreement.

These limitations apply to all causes of action, whether based on contract, tort including negligence, strict liability, or other legal theory. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations may not apply to you.

## 15. INDEMNIFICATION

We may assign these Terms and our rights and obligations hereunder at any time without notice or consent, including in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization, or sale of assets.

## 23. SEVERABILITY

If any provision of these Terms is found invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect. The invalid or unenforceable provision will be modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it valid and enforceable while preserving its intent, or if that is not possible, the provision will be severed from these Terms.

## 24. WAIVER

No waiver of any provision of these Terms will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of that provision or any other provision. Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of that right or provision.

## 25. ENTIRE AGREEMENT

You understand that this Agreement, together with any order forms, our Privacy Policy, and any other agreements expressly incorporated by reference, constitutes the entire agreement between you and us regarding the Services and supersedes all prior agreements, understandings, and communications, whether written or oral, regarding the same subject matter.
