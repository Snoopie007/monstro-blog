"What the F#$@ did you do?" 

Those were the last words Maste Ross told his website developer as he showed him the door out.

You see… Master Ross owns a very successful Taekwondo school down in Vancouver.

And about 6 months before this incident. Master Ross wanted to rebrand his school and hired a new website developer to rebuild his website from the group up.

But little did he know that this single decision would be the biggest mistake he had made in his business career.

And it wasn’t because the website wasn’t pretty or of quality.

In fact, it was a great-looking site and exactly what Master Ross had in mind. 

The problem was that before this new website went live.

Master Ross’s outdated website was actually bringing him on average 40-ish leads a month that he happily converted to 25 - 30 new students every month.

But once the new website went live, the number of leads tanked to just about 8 to 11 leads a month.

That’s a 73% drop in new opportunities and a whopping $28,800 in additional annual revenue lost!

And that’s just one month.

Truth be told, Master Ross had every right to be furious. It really wasn’t the website developer’s fault, nor was it Master Ross’ fault.

This is because they simply didn’t know the formula for website conversion.

C+L+E+A+R = Conversion.

Clear Path - Does your website provide a clear path for visitors to take the next step.

Low Friction Entry - Does your website cause a lot of friction for visitors to take the next step? Trial classes are great but what if they have questions and they’re not ready for a trial class?

Easy Connect - Make it easy for them to connect with you. This may be simple, most businesses don’t have a simple way for the visitors to connect and just ask simple questions.

Automate - What happens when someone contacts you. Do you have an automated process that notify you and your staff and respond quickly?

Responsiveness - Harvard Business Review study has shown that simply responding within 5 minutes will increase your conversion by 400%.

Here’s another interesting stat for you.

According to Ranktracker.com, “69% of small brands have not adopted any conversion rate optimization strategies.”

That means that if you’re not in the 31% of those who do, you probably have hidden revenue that they’re simply not capitalizing on.

So, what do you do? 

Do you start over again and spend another $2,000 to $5,000 on building yet another website? But who’s to ensure this new developer knows what they’re doing…

Luckily there is another way that won’t require you to redo your website and spend thousands of dollars to fix this issue.

In fact, all you need is to add simple software to your website.

This is exactly what the people at Monstro did for Master Ross. They added a simple line of code, a new button, and connected to an AI-Driven Website Textbot (not chatbot).

And boom, without completely redoing Master Ross’s website, they were able to bring his conversion rate back up and even improve.

Sounds crazy right? We couldn’t believe it either. 

But it checks out. It clearly follows the website conversion formula.

In fact, they have made a simple Analyzer that will instantly tell you how much money you’re potentially leaving on the table by not implementing this Website Conversion Formula.
