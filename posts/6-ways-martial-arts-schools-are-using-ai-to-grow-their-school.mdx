AI is a buzzword these days. It seems like everyone is trying to sell you the idea of using AI to improve your business. But can AI help you grow your business? Or is it just another trend that will come and go?

I think AI is here to stay, but it also isn't likely going to run your business any time soon.

AI is great, but it makes a lot of mistakes and doesn't always follow instructions. Sometimes it generates great work, but sometimes it's nothing special.

But it's hard to deny that AI will save you a lot of time and money if you're willing to put in a bit of effort.

You won't be able to push a button to generate amazing ads that will get you a lot of new students. You won't be able to push a button and get a high-converting sales letter. You won't be able to realistically use AI to book appointments for you without some tweaks and integration.

You'll be able to save 10, 20, or 30 hours a month if you put in some time working with AI. Here are 6 ways martial arts schools are using AI to reduce overhead and free up their time:

### 1 AI Appointment Booker

Probably the most popular and most in-demand feature of AI is to create an AI booker that will book an appointment automatically like a human assistant would for your school.

Imagine having an assistant that is on call 24/7, doesn't get tired, and will always respond to all your prospects' inquiries for only a fraction of the cost.

Here is an article I wrote earlier that details how we use AI appointment booking to help our school/studio owners increase their appointments by up to 202%.

### 2 AI Social Media Manager

One of the most popular features of Monstro is the ability to use AI to generate various social media content and then use our social planner to schedule them out to post on multiple channels at once.

Gone are the days of trying to figure out what to post. Use AI to generate a list of ideas for you, and then ask the AI to generate the content by following a template or structure.

Just be sure to proofread or spend a bit of time editing the content before posting it.

### 3 AI Automation for Personalization

Another way Monstro school/studio owners are using AI is to personalize automated email and marketing messages for each of their students individually.

You can collect information about your student and tell the AI to personalize the birthday email, a happy 6-month email, or an SMS campaign to improve your relationship with your student and retention.

### 4 AI Support

The fourth way that many schools use AI is to create a support bot to answer some of the most commonly asked questions members may ask from time to time.

While it is not advised to rely 100% on AI to answer all your support questions via a chatbot, it is possible to have AI read your website or provide it with a PDF of commonly asked questions, so it can respond accordingly.

### 5 AI Copywriter & Ads

While Monstro does not have this feature, we know some of its members are using AI to copywrite ads and generate attention-catching Facebook ads.

However, based on my experience, while you can generate ads and images with AI, you'll need to know how to run and manage ads before using them.

This is because from my experience, most AI-generated ads usually underperform those written by an experienced copywriter. As with any ads, you will want to test multiple versions before arriving at a winner.

### 6 Predictive Analytics for Student Retention

Finally, one of the key features we are looking to release in the upcoming months on Monstro is the ability to use AI to analyze member engagement and performance in real-time to predict which students/members are at risk of dropping out.

Allowing owners to intervene with targeted retention strategies, such as offering incentives or additional support, to prevent churn and increase the lifetime value of a member.

These are the 6 ways we know that martial arts school owners are actively using AI to improve their business. If you're using AI uniquely and interestingly to improve your school/studio or business, let us know. We would love to hear more about how you're using AI to grow your business.
