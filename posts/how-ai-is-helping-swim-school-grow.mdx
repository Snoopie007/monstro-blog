Artificial intelligence (AI) is changing how businesses operate, including swimming schools. But can AI truly revolutionize your swim school, or is it just a passing trend?

In my view, AI is here to stay, but it's unlikely to completely automate your processes anytime soon. While AI has many benefits, it's not perfect and doesn't always perform as expected. Sometimes it excels, other times it falls short.

However, it's clear that AI can save you time and money, if you're willing to put in some effort. But don't expect instant results like magically attracting tons of new students or creating perfect ads. Using AI to automate scheduling requires some tweaking and learning.

By investing time in working with AI, you could potentially save 10, 20, or even 30 hours a month. Here are six ways swimming schools are using AI to improve operations and save time:

### AI-Driven Booking System

One of AI's most valuable features is its ability to learn and be able to schedule automatically, like having a tireless assistant managing appointments for your institution. Picture having an assistant available 24/7, always energetic, handling inquiries from potential clients, all at a much lower cost than usual.

How much time and cost will this save for your swim school to develop an AI bot that will help you respond to your leads and prospects in minutes and assist them on booking a trial class.

No longer will you need to worry about losing prospects to your competitor because you were not able to answer your call or respond to a lead right away.

### Social Engagement

One really cool thing about Monstro is that it can use artificial intelligence to help you create posts for social media. It also has a tool to schedule your posts on many different platforms all at once.

You don't have to struggle to think of what to post anymore. Let Monstro suggest ideas for you and then create the content based on a set plan.

But it's important to check and make any changes to the content before you share it.

### Tailored Client Experiences

Another way Monstro helps swim school owners adapt to AI is by sending personalized emails and promotions to each student. You can learn more about your students and tell the AI to send customized birthday wishes, messages for their six-month milestones, or text message campaigns.

This helps build a stronger connection with each student and keeps them coming back to your school.

### Customer Inquiry

The fourth strategy many swim schools use is creating a support bot with AI to answer common questions from members. While you shouldn't rely only on AI for all support questions, you can use it to scan your website or a PDF with frequently asked questions to give helpful answers.

### Creating Ads

Though Monstro does not incorporate this feature, we know some members use AI to create ads and Facebook promotions. From what I've seen, while AI can help make ads and images, it's important to know how to run and manage promotions before relying on AI. Most AI-made ads don't perform as well as those created by skilled writers. Like any marketing effort, you need to try different versions to find what works best.

### Member Retention

Soon, we'll add a new feature to Monstro that uses AI to see how active and engaged members are in real-time. This AI tool will help predict which members might stop coming to the swimming school.

With this tool, owners can act early by offering special deals or extra support to keep members interested. This helps reduce the number of people leaving and increases the value of each member.

These are just some ways swimming school owners are using AI to improve their businesses. If you have any creative ideas for using AI in education or business, we'd love to hear them! Share your thoughts with us as we explore AI together.
