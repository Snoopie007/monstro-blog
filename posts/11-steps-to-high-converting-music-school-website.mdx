Often questions about marketing and growing a music school revolve around whether having a website is important. As of May 2024, the clear answer is "Yes."

In today's digital world, where people search online first, your website is their first impression of your music classes. So, it's not just about needing a website but deciding how fancy it needs to be.

The answer depends on your budget. You might not need a super fancy website at first. Start with a simple, easy-to-use site that shows off your music school well.

Websites can vary significantly in cost, from free options to over $50,000, depending on your specific needs and requirements. For most music schools, an investment between $800 and $5,000 generally yields satisfactory results. However, a $5,000 investment might seem excessive for those just starting out.

**Primarily, your website should aim to achieve two main objectives:**

1. Showcasing your music school in an engaging way that appeals to your target audience.
2. Converting visitors into enrolled students once they arrive on your site.
    
Here are eleven key elements of an effective music school website, distilled from comprehensive insights gathered from numerous music institutions around the world:

### 1 Page Load Time

An often-overlooked factor affecting website conversion isn't the design or button color, but the actual speed at which your website loads on both desktop and mobile devices.

Imagine this scenario: you're browsing Amazon, eagerly looking for a new book, musical instrument, or t-shirt, and you encounter an interminable loading time—exceeding 10 to 15 seconds. How does that make you feel? It breeds frustration, doesn't it?

Likewise, prospective students experience similar frustration. If your website loads slowly, most visitors are likely to abandon it and turn to your competitors. Page load speed is a critical metric that Google evaluates when ranking websites in its search results.

Google considers a website that loads in under 3 seconds as average, while under 2 seconds is deemed fast. If your website lags behind this benchmark, Google might view it as user-unfriendly and lower its search ranking. With reduced visibility on Google, you're essentially handing opportunities to your competitors on a silver platter.

### 2 Device Compatibility: Responsive Design

Responsive design is a fundamental concept in website architecture. It means that a website can adapt and function seamlessly across various devices, from desktop computers to mobile gadgets. According to data from thewebmaster.com in 2023, about 60% of online searches occur on mobile devices, with the remaining 40% happening on laptops or desktops. This underscores the importance of ensuring your website is accessible on all platforms—desktops, laptops, tablets like iPads, and mobile devices including Android and iPhones.

Having a responsive website doesn't just make users happy and boost the chances of turning visitors into potential customers. It also really helps with search engine optimization (SEO). For instance, Google prefers websites that work well on mobile devices, so they rank higher in search results.

### 3 Above the Scroll: Optimizing Your Website's First Impression

The "above the fold" concept originates from the newspaper industry, referring to the top half of a folded newspaper—the most visible part to prospective readers. Publishers realized that eye-catching headlines and stories in this section significantly boosted sales because of their prominence.

Similarly, on websites, this prime real estate is referred to as "above the scroll"—the section immediately visible to visitors without needing to scroll down. Optimizing this area is crucial as it forms the initial impression for potential clients. Here are key elements to emphasize in this section:

-   Clear Headline: Create a concise headline that clearly conveys what your music school offers and what makes it unique.  
-  Call to Action: Include at least one prominent call-to-action button or form to encourage visitors to take the next step.
-   Contact Information: Display your phone number prominently for easy access. 
-   Optional Description: Consider adding a brief description to provide additional information about your school and classes.

### 4 Incorporating CTAs and Offers: Catalyzing Action on Your Website

Incorporating Calls to Action (CTAs) on your website is a highly effective strategy to encourage potential clients to take action. CTAs typically include forms or buttons that direct visitors to the next step, such as booking a trial class, taking advantage of an offer, or starting your services. Examples of CTAs might include "Book a Trial Class," "Book a Free Trial," "Claim Offer," or "Get Started," providing clear instructions for visitors to sign up for your school.

To attract new clients, think about offering an irresistible incentive to get them to try your classes. This incentive should be special, not too risky for them, but really valuable, making your school stand out from others. While a free trial class is common, looking into other incentives can make your offer even more attractive. 

**Examples include:**

-   5 Free Class Pass
-   4 Weeks for $39.00
-   30 Days of Complimentary Classes
    
Keep in mind, a unique offer isn't mandatory to generate leads from your website, but offering an irresistible incentive can significantly boost your conversion rate. At Monstro, we use a "Starter Kit" as our CTA, a strategy that has proven highly effective in attracting new prospects.

### 5 Utilize Personalized Imagery

Our research suggests that music school websites featuring genuine personal photos, such as team pictures or instructors interacting with students, generally perform better than those using stock images.

Using personalized visuals, like candid snapshots of happy students or instructors leading classes, creates a sense of community and authenticity. It communicates to potential clients that real people, like them, are an essential part of your music school and are enjoying their experiences there.

**Examples of compelling personal imagery:**

### 6 Guiding Your Visitors Forward

It's easy to assume that others will navigate our website the same way we do, based on our own preferences and habits. However, each person is unique, interacting with your website in their own individual way.

What may seem intuitive to you might not be so obvious to your website visitors. Therefore, it's crucial to provide a clear and easy-to-follow pathway for them.

In all of our music school website designs, we include a dedicated section outlining the exact steps a prospective client should take to enroll in our client's music classes. This eliminates any confusion in the visitor's mind about what to do next if they're interested in our classes.

### 7 Social Validation and Customer Feedback

When my wife looks for after-school activities for our children, her first step is to read reviews from other parents. These testimonials are crucial in her decision-making process.

While Google reviews are valuable, having testimonials displayed directly on your website can greatly increase your conversion rates. Unfortunately, many music school websites lack testimonials or only have a few without accompanying visuals.

At our music school, we prioritize showcasing a wide range of testimonials from our satisfied customers directly on our website.

### 8 Pricing Page

Were you aware that 96% of music school websites refrain from displaying their pricing? Many school owners hesitate to list prices online, fearing that potential students will prioritize the cheapest option without considering the value their institution offers.

On the other hand, some schools do display prices and even allow students to enroll and pay directly through the website. However, another approach, often overlooked by many music school owners, is to create a pricing page with a form for prospective students to request a price list. Despite not displaying the prices upfront, this strategy allows schools to capture leads from those interested in pricing while still maintaining control over when and how this information is provided.

### 9 Messaging Tool

A messaging tool is a small icon typically positioned at the bottom of your website, allowing users to start a chat with you or your team regarding your music school and classes.

While live chat widgets are available, we recommend using them judiciously unless you have dedicated staff available around the clock or utilize an AI system to handle responses. One downside of live chat is that it often leads to inquiries about pricing, and if the user finds the rates unsatisfactory, they may leave without further interaction.

Our messaging tool takes a different approach: it first captures the user's name, phone number, and optionally their email before initiating a conversation. This data enables you to follow up with prospects via text message, even if you're not available for real-time chat monitoring. Additionally, with Monstro, you can access an AI capable of engaging prospects on your behalf through our messaging tool.

### 10 Easy Phone Access

While some prefer filling out forms, others prefer making direct calls. However, many music schools don't prominently display their phone numbers on their websites; often, they're hidden in the contact page or buried in the footer.

To accommodate both preferences, we include a "Click to Call" phone number prominently displayed at the top of the menu. This allows visitors who prefer phone calls over filling out forms to easily initiate a call with our clients.

Schedule Display (Optional)

Adding a schedule or calendar to your music school website can enhance conversions, although the effect may be minimal. Therefore, it's considered optional.

Apart from pricing, one of the most common inquiries from prospective clients is about your class schedule. By allowing website visitors to view your schedule online or even book directly from a calendar, you can potentially encourage those interested in your classes to take the next step.

### 11 Assembling Your Music School Website

Creating a high-converting music school website isn't easy. It requires the expertise of a graphic designer, a web developer, and a Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO) specialist.

But that's just the beginning.

To consistently attract traffic and potential students to your website, mastering the art of SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is crucial to ensure your site ranks well on Google.

The entire process can be time-consuming and costly. While you could opt for a budget-friendly $800 website from Fiverr, if it fails to effectively generate leads and students, you're essentially wasting your investment.

If you're serious about enhancing your online presence with a high-converting music school website, we've got you covered. For a limited time, Monstro is offering to deploy our proven music school website at no cost with any of our music school software options.
